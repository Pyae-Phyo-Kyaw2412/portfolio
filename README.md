## Projects
### Retail Industry

**Key Findings**
1	Top-Performing Products: Wi-Fi Router, Laptop, Security Camera and Treadmill.
2	Underperforming Products: Groceries Package A & B, Keyboard, Iron and Electric Kettle.
3	Regional Performance Disparities: Yangon (YGN) Sales Stronger, Mandalay (MDY) Lagging indicating potential distribution or demand issues in the Mandalay region.
4	End-of-Year Slump: Surprisingly, November and December show relatively lower sales than expected for end-of-year periods, which typically benefit from holiday shopping and promotional activities.
5	Top Performing Age Groups: 35-54 Age Group.
	
	
**Recommendations**
1	Leverage Top-Performing Products: Capitalize on this by ensuring continuous supply and competitive pricing. Expand upsell and cross-sell opportunities with related accessories (e.g., laptop bags, routers, network extenders).
2	Address Underperforming Product Categories: Consider bundling these with more popular products to increase sales. Assess customer feedback to determine why these products are underperforming (e.g., lack of awareness, pricing issues, or competition).
3	Enhance Distribution and Engagement in Mandalay: Investigate whether supply chain problems, fewer promotions, or lower customer engagement are contributing to this gap. Consider region-specific marketing campaigns or adjusting the product mix to better suit Mandalay’s market.
4	Address End-of-Year Sales Decline: Review the effectiveness of year-end marketing campaigns, and if necessary, introduce flash sales or last-minute promotions. Assess if there were supply chain issues or market competition affecting November and December sales.
5	Focus on Key Age Groups (35-54): Consider focusing on premium products, as this demographic may have higher disposable  income.

### Bank Customer Analysis

**Key Findings**
	
1)	Top Segments by Balance: Middle - High (39%), Senior - High (34%), Young - High (25%)
2)	Small Segments by Balance: Other 2%
3)	Concentration of Wealth: Wealth is highly concentrated in the top segments, which make up about
	98% of the total balance in the bank, while representing 87% of the customer base.
	
	
**Recommendations**
	
1)	Focus on Top Segments: The bank should focus on retaining these customers by offering premium
	services, personalized financial advice, and investment opportunities to keep them engaged and
	satisfied.
2)	Engage Low-Balance Segments: Offering targeted marketing campaigns and digital tools to help them
	manage their finances could increase engagement and potentially grow their balances over time.
3)	Targeted Marketing by Age Group: Tailor marketing strategies based on age group:
	For young customers, focus on growth products like investment accounts and loans for education or
	housing.
	For middle-aged customers, offer long-term investment products, mortgage loans, and retirement
	planning services.
	For senior customers, emphasize wealth preservation and retirement income products like fixed
	deposits or low-risk investments.
