## Projects
### Retail Products Analysis

![retail_dashboard](/assets/img/Retail_Dashboard.png)

**Key Findings**
1.	Top-Performing Products: Wi-Fi Router, Laptop, Security Camera, and Treadmill.
2.	Underperforming Products: Groceries Package A & B, Keyboard, Iron, and Electric Kettle.
3.	Regional Performance Disparities: Yangon (YGN) Sales Stronger, Mandalay (MDY) Lagging, indicating potential distribution or demand issues in the Mandalay region.
4.	End-of-Year Slump: Surprisingly, November and December show lower sales than expected for end-of-year periods, which typically benefit from holiday shopping and promotional activities.
5.	Top Performing Age Groups: 35-54 Age Group.
	
	
**Recommendations**
1.	Leverage Top-Performing Products: Capitalize on this by ensuring continuous supply and competitive pricing. Expand upsell and cross-sell opportunities with related accessories (e.g., laptop bags, routers, network extenders).
2.	Address Underperforming Product Categories: Consider bundling these with more popular products to increase sales. Assess customer feedback to determine why these products are underperforming (e.g., lack of awareness, pricing issues, or competition).
3.	Enhance Distribution and Engagement in Mandalay: Investigate whether supply chain problems, fewer promotions, or lower customer engagement are contributing to this gap. Consider region-specific marketing campaigns or adjusting the product mix to better suit Mandalay’s market.
4.	Address End-of-Year Sales Decline: Review the effectiveness of year-end marketing campaigns, and if necessary, introduce flash sales or last-minute promotions. Assess if there were supply chain issues or market competition affecting November and December sales.
5.	Focus on Key Age Groups (35-54): Consider focusing on premium products, as this demographic may have higher disposable  income.

### Bank Customers Analysis

![bank_dashboard](/assets/img/Bank.png)

**Key Findings**
	
1.	Top Segments by Balance: Middle - High (39%), Senior - High (34%), Young - High (25%)
2.	Small Segments by Balance: Other 2%
3.	Concentration of Wealth: Wealth is highly concentrated in the top segments, which make up about
	98% of the total balance in the bank, while representing 87% of the customer base.
	
	
**Recommendations**
	
1.	Focus on Top Segments: The bank should focus on retaining these customers by offering premium
	services, personalized financial advice, and investment opportunities to keep them engaged and
	satisfied.
2.	Engage Low-Balance Segments: Offering targeted marketing campaigns and digital tools to help them
	manage their finances could increase engagement and potentially grow their balances over time.
3.	Targeted Marketing by Age Group: Tailor marketing strategies based on age group:
	For young customers, focus on growth products like investment accounts and loans for education or
	housing.
	For middle-aged customers, offer long-term investment products, mortgage loans, and retirement
	planning services.
	For senior customers, emphasize wealth preservation and retirement income products like fixed
	deposits or low-risk investments.

**Recommendations**	
	
1.	Focus on Class A Products for Inventory Management and Marketing:
- Ensure that these products are always in stock to avoid losing revenue opportunities.
- Allocate more marketing budget to promote Class A products. Use targeted campaigns, cross-sell, and upsell strategies
	to boost sales further.
- Consider premium pricing or value-added promotions to increase profit margins.
2.	Improve Sales for Class B Products:
   - Run limited-time offers or bundle deals to encourage sales of these products.
   - Analyze which customer segments are purchasing these products and target similar demographics with personalized offers.
   - Evaluate customer feedback and reviews for these products to identify areas for improvement.
3.	Evaluate Class C Products for Phase-out or Repositioning:
   - Consider reducing inventory for these products to save costs.
   - If these products consistently underperform, consider phasing them out or repositioning them in a new category.
   - Use aggressive discounting to clear out existing stock.
4.	Leverage Best-Selling Products for Cross-Selling:
   - Top-performing products like Headphones, Biographies, and Shampoo should be used as anchors for cross-selling other complementary products.
5.	Focus on High-Performing Categories:
   - Introduce more products in the electronics and beauty categories to capture a larger market share.
   - Provide category-based promotions (e.g., "10% off all electronics" or "Free shipping for beauty products").
   - Build customer loyalty programs around these categories to encourage repeat purchases.
